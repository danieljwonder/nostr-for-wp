Two-way synchronization between WordPress content and Nostr protocol. Supports kind 1 notes and kind 30023 long-form content with NIP-07 browser extension or NIP-46 remote signer (bunker) signing.

== Description ==

Nostr for WordPress enables seamless two-way synchronization between your WordPress site and the Nostr protocol. Share your WordPress content on Nostr and publish Nostr content to your WordPress site.

**Key Features:**

* **Two-Way Sync**: Automatically sync content between WordPress and Nostr
* **NIP-07 Integration**: Use your browser extension to sign events securely
* **NIP-46 Remote Signer (Bunker)**: Let the server sign outbound events via a remote signer you control — enables scheduled posts with no browser present, while your private key never touches the server
* **Custom Post Types**: Dedicated "Notes" post type for kind 1 events
* **Long-Form Content**: Sync standard WordPress posts as kind 30023 events
* **NIP-05 Identity**: Create and manage a `.well-known/nostr.json` file for domain-based identity verification
* **Relay Management**: Configure multiple Nostr relays for redundancy
* **Conflict Resolution**: Smart timestamp-based conflict resolution
* **Opt-in Sync**: Choose which content to sync with Nostr
* **Real-time Updates**: Automatic inbound sync on content changes
* **Custom Frontend Display**: Theme-agnostic display for notes with hidden titles and clean styling
* **Block Templates**: Automatic block templates for block themes
* **Gutenberg Blocks**: Display notes anywhere using custom blocks
* **Shortcodes**: Embed notes in posts, pages, or widgets using shortcodes

**Content Types:**

* **Kind 1 (Notes)**: Short text notes using the custom "Notes" post type
* **Kind 30023 (Long-form)**: Standard WordPress posts with full content, metadata, and tags

**Roadmap:**

* Follow Button to Grow Your Nostr Audience on Your Site
* Zap support for bitcoin donations over Lightning
* NIP-01 syncing Nostr Profile Data with WordPress profiles
* Deeper integration with NIP 65 for relay management
* NIP-51 Support for Link List Pages
* Integrated Nostr Profile Statistics and Analytics


**Requirements:**

* WordPress 5.0 or higher
* PHP 7.4 or higher
* Nostr relay access (outbound wss:// / TCP 443 connectivity from the server)
* For NIP-07 signing: a compatible browser extension (e.g., Alby, nos2x, etc.)
* For NIP-46 remote signer (bunker) signing: the PHP sodium extension (bundled with PHP 7.2+, used to encrypt connection secrets at rest) and a NIP-46 signer you control (e.g. nak bunker, nsec.app, Amber)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/nostr-for-wp` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Go to Settings > Nostr to configure your Nostr connection
4. Install a NIP-07 compatible browser extension
5. Connect your Nostr account in the settings page
6. Configure your preferred relays
7. Enable sync for individual posts and notes

== Remote signer (NIP-46) ==

By default, outbound events are signed by a NIP-07 browser extension, so someone with the extension must be present to publish. Selecting **Remote signer / bunker (NIP-46)** under Settings > Nostr lets the server sign outbound kind 1 and kind 30023 events by talking to a remote signer ("bunker") over Nostr relays. This enables scheduled posts and publishing without a browser, and your nsec never touches the WordPress server — the plugin only keeps its own client key for talking to the bunker.

**Setup with nak bunker (example):**

1. On a machine you control, run: `nak bunker --persist wss://relay.damus.io wss://nos.lol`
2. Copy the printed `bunker://...` URI (it contains the signer pubkey, relays, and a one-time secret).
3. In Settings > Nostr, select "Remote signer / bunker (NIP-46)", paste the URI, click Save, then "Connect and test". The panel shows the user pubkey (hex and npub) the bunker signs with.
4. Publish or schedule posts normally — the server signs them via the bunker.

All connections are outbound websockets: neither the bunker nor the WordPress host needs open inbound ports. The bunker URI (its secret authorises signing) and the plugin's client key are encrypted at rest using a key derived from your wp-config.php salts.

**Locked or offline bunker:** publishing in WordPress never fails because of Nostr. If the bunker is unreachable or locked (e.g. `nak bunker --persist` requires a password unlock after a reboot), the Nostr publication is queued and retried via WP-Cron with backoff (5 min, 15 min, 60 min, then hourly for up to 24 hours). Queued/failed state is shown per post in the post list's "Nostr" column and in the "Nostr Remote Signer" box on the edit screen, with a manual "Retry now" action. Each post is published exactly once: the signed event is stored and reused on retry, never re-signed.

== Usage ==

**Displaying Notes:**

* **Shortcodes:**
  * `[nostr_note id="123"]` - Display a single note by WordPress ID
  * `[nostr_notes limit="10" orderby="date" order="DESC"]` - Display multiple notes with customizable options

* **Gutenberg Blocks:**
  * **Nostr Notes Block** - Add from the block inserter (Widgets category). Configure number of notes, sort order, and display options.

* **Automatic Display:**
  * Notes automatically use custom templates for clean card-based styling
  * Works with both classic and block themes
  * Block templates are automatically applied for block themes

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Nostr account? =

Yes, you need a Nostr account. For signing you can use either a NIP-07 compatible browser extension (Alby, nos2x, ...) or a NIP-46 remote signer / bunker (nak bunker, nsec.app, Amber, ...).

= What content gets synced? =

By default, all new notes posted to Nostr sync with WordPress. For any content created within the WordPress dashboard, you can use the browser signer to sync with your relays. You can disable sync for individual posts using the checkbox in the post editor.

= How does conflict resolution work? =

When content is edited in both WordPress and Nostr, the version with the most recent timestamp wins. This ensures the latest changes are always preserved.

= Can I use multiple relays? =

Yes, you can configure multiple Nostr relays for redundancy. The plugin will attempt to publish to all configured relays.

= Is my private key stored on the server? =

No, your private key is never stored on the server in either mode. With NIP-07, signing happens in your browser extension. With NIP-46, signing happens in the remote bunker you control; the server only stores its own client key and the bunker connection URI, both encrypted at rest.

= Can scheduled posts publish to Nostr automatically? =

Yes — with the NIP-46 remote signer configured, scheduled posts are signed and published to Nostr at their scheduled time via WP-Cron, with no browser session open. In NIP-07 mode this is not possible because the browser extension must sign.

= What happens if a relay is down? =

The plugin will attempt to publish to all configured relays. If some relays are down, the content will still be published to available relays.

= How are notes displayed on the frontend? =

Notes automatically use custom display templates that hide titles and show only the content with clean metadata. The plugin provides block templates for block themes and works seamlessly with modern or classic themes. You can also use shortcodes or Gutenberg blocks to display notes anywhere on your site.

= Can I customize how notes look? =

The plugin includes CSS styling that provides a clean, card-based design for notes. This styling is theme-agnostic and works across different WordPress themes. For advanced customization, you can override the CSS or modify the templates in the plugin's `templates/` and `block-templates/` directories.
